<h3> ***APPENDIX 2: METHOD OF EVALUATION </h3>

1. <b> Autopsy </b>

If the autopsy was performed at an outside institution, <b>you must have the
report </b> to code as diagnosis by autopsy.

2. <b> Examination </b>

The subject must have been examined in person at your ADC/ institution or by
genetic studies staff associated with your ADC/ institution to code as
diagnosis by examination. Medical records may or may not have been used when
assigning diagnosis.

3. <b> Medical record review from formal dementia evaluation </b>

Medical records should be from an examination that focused specifically on
dementia; that was performed by a neurologist, geriatrician, or psychiatrist;
and that includes a neurologic examination, an imaging study, and cognitive
testing (e.g., MMSE, Blessed, or more formal tests). A telephone interview
may also be used to collect additional information.

4. <b> Review of general medical records AND co-participant and/or subject
 telephone interview </b>

General medical records can be of various types, including those from a
primary-care physician's office, hospitalization records, nursing home
records, etc. They may include a neurologic exam and a cognitive test such
as the MMSE along with a medical history. <b> The telephone interview </b>
with the subject and/or the co- participant should include a medical history
to capture the nature and presentation of cognitive deficits, if present,
and age of onset if symptomatic. If the subject is normal or is in the early
stages of cognitive impairment, brief formal cognitive testing should be
included in the interview.

5. <b> Review of general medical records ONLY </b>

See definition No. 4 above. If general medical records are used to diagnose a subject as demented or not demented, they should include a medical
history, neurologic exam, and a cognitive test such as an MMSE. In most
cases, general medical records alone should not be used to assign a
diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, or of any of the FTLD spectrum
subtypes, or of parkinsonian disorders other than Parkinson's disease.

6. <b> Subject and/or co-participant telephone interview </b>

See definition No. 4 above.

7. <b> Family report </b>

Family report should be coded when the co-participant for the family reports
a subject as having been diagnosed with a particular disorder. In most
cases, family report alone should not be used to assign a diagnosis of mild
cognitive impairment, or of any of the FTLD spectrum subtypes, or of
parkinsonian disorders other than Parkinson's disease.

adcs_infoobtained,adcs_mci_activities_of_daily_living_invent,"This inventory is completed in interview format with the informant/family member of the participant.

<u>NOTES</u>:

(1) {P} refers to the participant and should be replaced by the participant's name or relationship to the study partner each time an ADL question is asked of the study partner.

(2) This ADL inventory must be given in the format of an interview of the study partner, either directly or by telephone. The form should NOT be given to a study partner to complete on his/her own.

<u>READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS TO THE STUDY PARTNER</u>:

I am going to ask you about a number of daily activities that {P} may have performed during the past 4 weeks. Please tell me about {P}'s actual performance, not about what he/she could have done if an opportunity had arisen. For each activity that {P} attempted, I am going to ask you to choose out of a number of descriptions that best fit his/her most usual performance.

For some activities, I'll ask about whether {P} performed independently or with supervision or help. Let me explain how we are defining these words:

Independently means that {P} completed the activity without being helped. We still consider it independent if {P} was reminded or prompted to get started, or received a little prompting while performing the activity.

With supervision means that {P} required verbal reminders and instructions while doing the activity.

With help means that {P} was given some degree of physical assistance by another person to perform the activity.

<u>INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE RATER</u>:

If the study partner states that {P} had no opportunity to perform the task during the past 4 weeks (e.g., {P} did not have access to a telephone, therefore could not possibly make phone calls), the response should be recorded as ""No"".

If either the study partner's answer or the questionnaire are unclear, please make notes on the case report form detailing the problem.
